# cloudwave-instances-dashboard

This Openstack Horizon panel allows to visualize the status of the hosts and the instances running on top of them inside the CloudWave testbed. Adding to the metrics for the hosts described in the Infrastructure panel (https://github.com/MDSLab/cloudwave-nets_and_computes-dashboard.git), some metrics of the instances are introduced such as cpu utilization (a standard Openstack metric), cpu and memory used retrieved from the CW Probe (https://github.com/MDSLab/cloudwave-probe.git) developed by UniME itself.
